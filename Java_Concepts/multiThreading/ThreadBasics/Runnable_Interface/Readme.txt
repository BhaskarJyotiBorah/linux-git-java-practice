OBSERVATIONS:

1. We cannot directly use methods of Thread, who's class implements Runnable interface.
2. We have to create an object of the class, then Create an object of Thread and pass the object's reference in the constructor of the Thread
3. We see the output i.e. the Multi-Threading behaviour
